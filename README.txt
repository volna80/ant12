It is implementation of Ant algorithm for AI Challenge "Ants" 2011

The result you can see here - http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=225  looks like it isn't going to win :-)

It uses some ideas from Ant colony optimization algorithms for decision making and "Wave" pathfind algorithm.

The attack algorithm is weak. 

That's it.
